 i dosent belong to where i never leaved where i was never was</p>
 <p>how glad i am i met me at starts of my own sky that was build for me that was waiting for me</p>
 <p>the croud doesnt look crowded anymore ,the noise isnt nosy any more the darkness isnt darker amymore
  because i found the corner of me in the croud which isnt croded,i found the light which isnt dark,i found
   i silence which is calm and i found it in me and it ws always in me waiting to be found <p>
